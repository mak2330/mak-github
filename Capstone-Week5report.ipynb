The rank of pupular venues near each neighbourhood will be gathered and made into one hot encoding before applying k-means clustering."

So the data was gathered by checking on Google Map manually since there are only 6 neighbourhoods.\n\nThen we looped through each neighbourhood and query the Foursquare to get popular venues nearby. The venues were then turned into one-hot encoding and normalized to be clustered by k-means.\n\nWith k-means clustering, the neighbourhoods were clustered into 3 clusters and finally the clustering was displayed on the folium map."

The other 2 neighbourhoods, Changi Bay and Paya Lebar are clustered in 2 groups on its own because these two areas have some special usage. Changi Bay has ferry station and Paya Lebar has military base. So they are clustered into seperate groups by their own. \n\nThis result is useful for people who are considering which area to live in.
